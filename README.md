HasEmailAuthentication, for Rails/ActiveRecord 5.0+, is a micro library that compliments `has_secure_password` by providing `has_email_authentication`.

This library was developed for- and extracted from [HireFire].

The documentation can be found on [RubyDoc].


### Compatibility

- Rails/ActiveRecord 5.0+
- Ruby (MRI) 2.5+


### Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle`.

```rb
gem "has_email_authentication"
```


### Example

This library requires you to have an `email` column in the table associated
with the model you're using.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_email_authentication
end
```

This does a few things:

- Adds presence, format and uniqueness validations on `email`
- Downcases `email` before saving the record
- Provides a `User.find_by_email(params[:email])`
    convenience method which downcases the provided email
